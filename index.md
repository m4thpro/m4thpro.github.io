# manifesto

we seek to create math-based games. each game should teach the user about math, and not simply use math as something to overcome. 

mathematics solves problems---it doen't create them.

let's see some pico8 code

```lua
function _init()
-- initialize code
-- called once on program startup
end

function _update()
-- changes behavor based on pressing buttons
-- called once per update at 30fps
end

function _draw()
-- draws stuff to the screen
-- called once per visible frame
end
```
