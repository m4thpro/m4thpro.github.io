# The goal

Move right and left to choose a digit; press a button to select the
digit.

Your goal is to select four digits which are in order, or in reverse
order.

# Why is this always possible?

In any permutation of the digits 0123456789, you can always find at
least four digits which are in order or four digits which are in
reverse order.  You can prove this by invoking Dilworth'ss theorem.
